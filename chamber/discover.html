            <h2>Discover Garden Park!</h2>
            <p>&emsp;The city of Boston was founded in <span class="strike">1970?</span> <span class="strike">1983??</span> 1630 and/or 1822, and is the capital of the state of Massachusetts. It is a city of many firsts, including the US's first subway system, public park, public library, public school, public pool full of tea, blaseball team with a 14-player lineup, and it is the first location to have visited all four quadrants of the immaterial plane!</p>
            <p>&emsp;It is a verdant and bustling metropolis, home to such a large amount of lifeforms it's uncountable! (Editor's note: the last known population count was 675,647 shortly before the Big Dunk, a cataclysmic event that left the city perpetually fluctuating both spatially and temporally. Naturally, an accurate census today would be impossible, as the population count changes constantly. Also the Garden itself is home to massive amounts of sentient plant life and whether they count themselves as individuals or a hivemind varies on a spectrum, making a precise census count complicated, to say the least.) The downtown area is bustling, rich with history and nature, and comparitively easy to navigate. A great place to visit for the whole family, if you're careful!</p>
            <p>&emsp;Boston's economy (if you can call it such) is thriving, centering mainly on leisure, tea, and gardening. Splorts are also important to the city's culture, as it has been home to the Boston Flowers blaseball team since all the way back in Prehistory I! Come see a home game down at Boston Garden stadium sometime and cheer for the Flowers to win/non-lose/survive! Just remember to bring your raincoat, birdseed, and fireproof sunblock!</p>
